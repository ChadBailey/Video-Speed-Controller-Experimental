# Video Speed Controller Experimental

This repository houses experimental features which may or may not make it in to
the parent project
[Video Speed Controller](https://github.com/igrigorik/videospeed).

The purpose of this is to have a place for testing features, ideas, or any
change at all in order to get feedback on how the change is working before
merging it into the larger parent project. This allows us a controlled way of
experimenting without alienating the users who depend on the reliability of this
tool.

At any given time this version may be in a broken state, and the reliability is
not guaranteed. This is why it is called experimental. If you want the version
which is stable and strives to work well for all users all the time, please get
[Video Speed Controller](https://github.com/igrigorik/videospeed).

I think I may have made the point clear, but I do think it bears repeating. The
goal of this effort is not to fork the parent project and create a "better"
version of it, but rather to have a playground for testing out ideas with the
expectation of either removing it all together or adding it into the parent
project.
